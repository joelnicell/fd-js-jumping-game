        <h2>The bouncy dino ü¶ñ- epic jumps and prickly adventures!</h2>
        <p>In a prehistoric world full of stubborn cacti, only the bounciest dinos survive! 
          Get ready to train your reflexes and leap over these pointy obstacles that seem to say, ‚ÄúYou shall not pass!‚Äù 
          With every jump, our dino gets faster, and those pesky cacti get knocked on their‚Ä¶ spikes.</p>
        <p>Don't let these prickly plants ruin your day! 
            Jump, jump, and jump again‚Äîbecause dinos don't have time to waste when it comes to fun and games!</p>

            <p>The game starts with any click on the screen.</p>
            <p>Once the game begins, you‚Äôll hear a funny background music playing.<p>
            <p>Your mission is to help the Dino jump over the cacti by pressing the Space, arrow up key or clicking anywhere (not).</p>
            <p>Every time you successfully avoid a cactus, you earn one point.</p>
            <p>Be careful! If the Dino touches a cactus, the game is over.</p>
            <p>You can pause or resume the game anytime using the Play/Pause button.</p>
            <p>The game also shows the elapsed time, the height your dino reaches when jumping, and its velocity.</p>
            <p>Try to get the highest score possible and have fun!</p>
