## Frontend Development - Mayerfeld Consulting: Jumping Game

preview at: https://joelnicell.github.io/fd-js-jumping-game/

A game made using purely Vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript

The game is inspired by the offline Dino game from the Chrome Browser. You play as a dinosaur character, jumping over obstacles as they race towards you.

The game keeps track of your score for every obstacle you jump over, and gets faster the more points you have.

Elements are made and manipulated using html elements and their css styles. Game mechanics, such as collisions and point scoring were made using the DOM's API such as ```getBoundingClientRect()```. Animation used the ```requestAnimationFrame()```.
